## Description
**IronChef is `Ice Bucket Challenge` for Recipe.**

Everyone loves foods, but not many people cook. Having a healthy diet is a key to having a wonderful life. IronChef helps everyone to enjoy the cooking by applying the essence of the gamification. The rule could be similar to Ice Bucket Challenge. If you receive a recipe challenge from your friends, you SHOULD accept it, cook it, and post your recipe on the net. Then you could challenge some your friends for their recipes!
