## Description
**Cook Me Now is `Ice Bucket Challenge` for Recipe.**

Everyone loves foods, but not many people cook. Having a healthy diet is a key of having a wonderful life. `Cook Me Now` helps everyone to enjoy the cooking by applying the essence of the gamification. Rule could be similar with Ice Bucket Challenge. If you recieve a recipe challenge from your friends, you *SHOULD* accept it, cook it, and post your recipe on the net. Then you could challenge some your friends for their recipes!
